"Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding and missing offense data. Unless otherwise noted, data represent prisoners in the physical custody of state correctional authorities, or those held for the state in privately operated prison facilities, on December 31, 2021. Percentages are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. For prisoners convicted of more than one offense, BJS defines the most serious offense as the offense with the longest sentence. States can report up to three offenses in the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) and are asked to single out the offense with the longest sentence. If they do not identify the offense with the longest sentence, BJS assumes an order of sentencing that prioritizes violent offenses, followed by property, drug, and public order offenses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
