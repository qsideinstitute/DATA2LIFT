"Note: Excludes prisoners held in local jails, other states, or private facilities, unless otherwise noted. Rated capacity is the number of prisoners or beds that a facility can hold as set by a rating official. Operational capacity is the number of prisoners that a facility can hold based on staffing and services. Design capacity is the number of prisoners that a facility can hold as set by the architect or planner. Lowest capacity represents the minimum estimate of capacity submitted by the jurisdiction, while highest capacity represents the maximum estimate of capacity. When a jurisdiction could provide only a single estimate of capacity, it was used as both the lowest and highest capacity. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,
…Not available. Jurisdiction does not measure this type of capacity.,,,,,,,,,
:Not calculated.,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,
"a/Due to differences in the dates when data were extracted, the federal custody count reported for the calculation of capacity differs slightly from the yearend custody count reported in the National Prisoner Statistics. The count includes all federal prisoners, regardless of conviction status or sentence length.",,,,,,,,,
b/State defines capacity differently from BJS. Data reflect the state’s definitions. See Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website.,,,,,,,,,
"c/Capacity excludes nontraditional confinement, such as halfway houses and electronic monitoring.",,,,,,,,,
d/Private facilities are included in capacity and custody counts. See Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website.,,,,,,,,,
e/Capacity includes state-owned facilities that are staffed with employees of a private correctional company.,,,,,,,,,
f/Operational capacity may include some pretrial detainee beds excluded from the custody count.,,,,,,,,,
"g/State does not include Detention and Diversion center beds, or nonsex-specific hospital beds in its capacity count.",,,,,,,,,
