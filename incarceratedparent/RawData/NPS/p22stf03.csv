Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents age 18 or older in a given category. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Rates for 2021 and earlier may have been revised from previous reports. See table 6 for rates.",,,,,
