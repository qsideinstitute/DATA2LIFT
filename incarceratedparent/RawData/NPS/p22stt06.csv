"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners age 18 or older under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents age 18 or older or per 100,000 U.S. residents age 18 or older in a given category. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Rates for 2021 and earlier may have been revised from previous reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
