"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Percentages and counts are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Includes adult prisoners held in nonsecure community corrections facilities and adults and persons age 17 or younger held in privately operated facilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not separate persons of two or more races or other races from the individual race categories when reporting to the National Prisoner Statistics. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
