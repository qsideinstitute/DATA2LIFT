"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These persons were not included in the custody and jurisdiction counts in this table, because they were housed in local jails; however, because the BJS definition of imprisonment rate includes persons sentenced to more than 1 year in a correctional facility, these persons (1,133 in 2021 and 1,133 in 2022) were included in the imprisonment rate calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
