# README for the `RawData` Folder

## Overview

The `RawData` folder contains data sourced from two major programs: the Survey of Prison Inmates (SPI) and the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. Each subfolder contains the unzipped contents of the respective data files and a readme file from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

## Contents

- **`SPI` Subfolder**:
  - Contains data from the Survey of Prison Inmates (SPI).
  - Files store data for tables, figures, and other resources from the report *Parents in Prison and Their Minor Children: Survey of Prison Inmates, 2016* by Maruschak and Bronson (2021).

- **`NPS` Subfolder**:
  - Contains data from the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program.
  - Files store data for tables, figures, and other resources from the report *Prisoners in 2022 – Statistical Tables* by Carson and Kluckow (2023).

## Usage

- The data files within the `SPI` and `NPS` subfolders are used as primary sources for research, analysis, and reporting on the children of incarcerated parents. They are processed through various scripts in the `Scripts` folder to extract and analyze relevant data.
- Users are referred to the individual readme files in each subfolder for a thorough understanding of the available data.
