# README for the `RawData` Folder

## Overview

The `RawData` folder contains data sourced from two major programs: the Survey of Prison Inmates (SPI) and the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. Each subfolder contains the unzipped contents of the respective data files and a readme file from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). Relevant data tables are reformatted for analysis and stored in `.Rdata` files.
