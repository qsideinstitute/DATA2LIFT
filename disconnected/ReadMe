This folder contains code to download PUMS data and count the number of disconnected youth in each PUMA. Disconnected youth are defined as individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 (inclusive) who are not in school and are not employed. This code currently downloads and processes data from 2021.

To download PUMS data, run Scripts/downloadDisconnectedData.R. This will save raw data in the RawData folder. To process the data and make maps of the prevalence of disconnected youth, run Scripts/makeDisconnectedMap.R. This will save maps in the Plots folder.

The PUMS variables currently used in this code are described below. Definitions of all PUMS variables used in 2021 are here: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMS_Data_Dictionary_2021.pdf
